<h3>Analysis of Hotel Price Data from the <b>MakeMyTrip</b> website for major cities like Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata</h3>

The dataset is available on kaggle you can take a look at the dataset: 🔗[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewgeorgeissac/hotel-price-data-of-cities-in-india-makemytrip). I've done some analysis on this data such as 

> * hotel qualities
> * average people choice which kind of hotels
> * High rating actually increase number of customers or not
> * Average hotel price
> * Finding out important landmarks based on the hotel price and no of customers
and many more.

## 💿 Data Card:
The data consists of these columns:
* Hotel Name
* Rating
* Rating Description
* Reviews
* Star rating
* Location
* Nearest Landmark
* Distance to the Landmark
* Price
* Tax
also Price is excluding the Tax. So total price will be Price + Tax

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Approach:
* Cleaning the data - Renaming some columns, dropping unnecessary columns etc.
* Visualizing the missing values (with `seaborn` and `missingno` library)
* Plotting correlation between the data [like Price and Tax has a strong correlation etc.]
* Plotting data individually [like Places vs Price, Reviews vs Price etc.]
* Conclusion about the analysis.

## 🤝 Collaboration: 
Anybody interested in this and have some suggestion to improve or some more analysis on this dataset and want to contribute can give a **PR**. Anykind of contribution will be highly appriciated. Thank you.
